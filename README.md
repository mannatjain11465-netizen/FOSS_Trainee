## A Small Story from College

We once had a **Treasure Hunt** on campus with the permission to roam only till **4 AM**.  
But hum 5-6 logon ne socha:

**"Ek ghanta aur ruk jaate hain… Subah ho hi jayegi."**  
Confidence ✅ 
Permissions ❌

Cut to **5:30 AM**, we were returning, and suddenly we heard the Warden’s voice.
Half of us hid behind random places and the rest **vanished into GH2**.Somehow the warden didn’t see us. With **guard uncle's silent support**, we went back in hostel safely.

Yes, we survived. 

## Something To Say
College gets *overwhelming* sometimes… 
but somehow, we all manage.
Some days we’re **laughing**,
some days we’re **tired or stressed**,
some days it’s just **chai** at odd hours.
*We’re all just figuring it out.*
